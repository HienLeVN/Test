How is our product different?
	Our product is distinct from the above competitors. Particularly, the main objective of this product is to support the user in selecting the course for their next semester. This is a tool where the user can explore their capabilities to join courses and get connected with the community. Furthermore, for each course in the degree progress, the student can access past syllabuses that are uploaded by students who have completed the course before. To make the product more active, we introduce the credit system that allows users to spend it to unlock the uploaded materials and earn by making contributions. Overall, our product is a combination of all our competitors.
 
Why our product is better for specific uses and scenarios?
The other competitors just focus on their main task such as rating the professors for specific courses (Rate My Professor), a forum to find classmate or discussion (r/Yorku subreddit), or planning on completing the degree (Coursedelta). Whereas, our product combines those features as once so that the user has all the tools they need instead of jumping sites. Imagine as a new post-secondary student, everything is vague and demand for support is very high for you. Our product is an all-in-one plattform that can let you stay updated with your degree progress, has a overview about your future instructors, and also find a community for you to stay connected. The competitors didnâ€™t focus on these features since their main objective is to serve a particular demand where as we focus on every perspectives that the student may need for their study career.
